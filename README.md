# Pour Choices CLI — ChordPro Catalog Manager

A command-line tool built for the [Pour Choices band](https://pourchoicesmusic.com) to manage the
band's full library of ChordPro (`.cho`) song files.

Two CSV files are the heart of the system:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `song-catalog.csv` | Master song library — one row per `.cho` file, all metadata |
| `gigs.csv` | Gig assignments — which songs are in which gig, in what order, and which RC-500 slot |

They are kept deliberately separate so the catalog can be a stable, long-lived reference while setlists
change freely gig to gig without touching song metadata.

```

The catalog and the setlist are **independent edit surfaces**. You can
re-key a song, rename an artist, or update a Nord preset in the catalog
without touching any setlist. Likewise you can rebuild a setlist from
scratch without disturbing the catalog.

RC-500 backing-track slot numbers are **per-gig assignments** stored in
`gigs.csv` — they are never a property of the song itself.

## 2. Data Model

### `song-catalog.csv`

One row per `.cho` file. All permanent metadata for that specific file version lives here.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `TITLE` | Song title |
| `ARTIST` | Artist or band name |
| `KEY` | Musical key of this specific `.cho` file |
| `DURATION` | Song duration (e.g. `3:30`) |
| `TEMPO` | BPM |
| `COUNTIN` | Count-in type — beat buddy, backing track, etc. |
| `BACKING` | Backing-track device: `RC` (RC-500 looper), `BB` (BeatBuddy drummer), or blank (no backing) |
| `NORD` | Voice preset on the Nord keyboard |
| `ROLAND` | Voice preset on the Roland keyboard |
| `VE` | Vocal effects preset |
| `PERFORMANCE KEY` | Key the band actually performs in (may differ from the file's `KEY`) |
| `TIME SIGNATURE` | Time signature (e.g. `4/4`) |
| `CAPO` | Guitar capo position, if any |
| `SONG ID` | Unique identifier — derived from the file path (e.g. `ABC:B:BillyJoel:PianoMan`) |
| `SONG LABEL` | RC-500 display label — shown on the guitarist's loop station screen (max 12 chars) |

> **`CHORDPRO FILENAME` is not stored in the CSV.** The `SONG ID` encodes the
> full path implicitly. The file `cho/ABC/B/BillyJoel/PianoMan.cho` maps to
> `SONG ID = ABC:B:BillyJoel:PianoMan`.

> **`RC SLOT` is not in this CSV.** Slot numbers are per-gig and live in `gigs.csv`.
> The catalog only records *which device* backs a song — not which slot.

#### SONG ID format

```
<alpha-group>:<initial>:<ArtistCamelCase>:<TitleCamelCase>
```

Examples:

| SONG ID | File |
|---|---|
| `ABC:B:BillyJoel:PianoMan` | `cho/ABC/B/BillyJoel/PianoMan.cho` |
| `DEF:E:EltonJohn:Daniel` | `cho/DEF/E/EltonJohn/Daniel.cho` |
| `ABC:B:BillyJoel:PianoMan-a` | `cho/ABC/B/BillyJoel/PianoMan-a.cho` *(key variant — see below)* |

---

### `gigs.csv`

One row per song-in-gig assignment. Songs appear here only when they are
assigned to a specific gig.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `GIG` | Gig identifier slug, date-first (e.g. `2026-06-14-rusty-nail`) |
| `SONG ID` | Foreign key into `song-catalog.csv` — **always the base version** (no key suffix) |
| `SET` | Compound position code — encodes set letter and song position within it |
| `RC SLOT` | RC-500 slot assigned for this gig — blank until `assign-backing-track-slots` is run |

> **RC SLOT is gig-specific.** Running `assign-backing-track-slots` for one gig
> populates that gig's rows only — other gigs are never touched. `copy-gig` always
> copies rows with a blank RC SLOT so the new gig starts fresh and gets its own
> independent slot assignment.

> **RC SLOT only applies to RC songs.** BeatBuddy songs (`BACKING=BB`) never get
> a slot — the BeatBuddy has its own beat selection independent of the RC-500.

#### SET code convention

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `A01` | Set A, song 1 |
| `A02` | Set A, song 2 |
| `B01` | Set B, song 1 |
| `C03` | Set C, song 3 |
| `Z01` | Backup pool, song 1 (not printed on fan setlists) |

Songs are sorted by SET code when a setlist is exported.

#### Foreign key rule

`gigs.csv` references songs by **base SONG ID only** — never a key-variant ID.
The system enforces this at read time and will throw a descriptive error if a
variant ID (e.g. `PianoMan-a`) is found in the file, telling you exactly what
to change it to.

---

### Song Versions and Key Variants

Some songs exist in multiple `.cho` files — a *base version* and one or
more *key variants* transposed to suit vocals or guitar playability:

| SONG ID | KEY | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ABC:B:BillyJoel:PianoMan` | C | base version — always present |
| `ABC:B:BillyJoel:PianoMan-a` | A | key variant for guitar |

**Rule:** The base version (no suffix) must always exist in the catalog. If
only a variant exists, the system will throw when attempting a setlist join.

**Why two versions exist:**

- `BACKING`, `SONG LABEL`, and all other metadata are written to **all** versions
  of a song, because the guitarist may open either `.cho` file on stage.
- `{meta: rc-slot: N}` is written by `assign-backing-track-slots` to all
  `.cho` versions of a song, so the slot is visible regardless of which file
  is open on the iPad.
- Setlists reference only the base SONG ID — the system treats "Piano Man"
  as one song regardless of how many transposed files exist.

Use `./find-song-id` to discover SONG IDs for use in gig assignments:

```zsh
./find-song-id "piano"
```

```
TITLE                   ARTIST       KEY   SONG ID                         VARIANTS
Piano Man               Billy Joel   C     ABC:B:BillyJoel:PianoMan        +1 key variant
```

The `SONG ID` column always shows the base version — safe to paste directly into `gigs.csv`.

---

### Backing Track Devices

The `BACKING` column in `song-catalog.csv` stores the **device type**, not a slot number.

| Value | Device | RC SLOT used? |
|---|---|---|
| `RC` | RC-500 loop station — plays a pre-recorded audio backing track | Yes — assigned per gig in `gigs.csv` |
| `BB` | BeatBuddy pedal — generates a drum pattern live | No — beat is selected on the hardware |
| *(blank)* | No backing track — live acoustic or click-free | No |

The `getBacking()` accessor on a setlist entry returns:
- `"BB"` for BeatBuddy songs
- The RC-500 slot number (from `gigs.csv`) for RC songs
- `""` for no backing

---

## 3. Workflows

### Adding a new song to the library

```zsh
# 1. Drop the .cho file into the right cluster directory:
#    cho/<alpha-group>/<initial>/<ArtistCamelCase>/TitleCamelCase.cho
#
#    Path uses the simplified form; metadata can be richer:
#      {title: Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)}  ← full title; path just uses MovingOut
#      {artist: Billy Joel}                  ← primary artist; path matches
#      {key: A}                              ← required; OnSong needs it explicit
#
# 2. Import it — SONG ID is derived from the path automatically:
./import-song cho/ABC/B/BillyJoel/MovingOut.cho --dry-run   # preview first
./import-song cho/ABC/B/BillyJoel/MovingOut.cho             # add to catalog
#
# 3. Open song-catalog.csv in Google Sheets, fill in remaining metadata
# 4. Save CSV → tidy → push metadata back to the file:
./tidy-song-catalog
./update-song cho/ABC/B/BillyJoel/MovingOut.cho
#
# 5. Confirm catalog and file agree:
./verify-catalog
```

### Updating song metadata

```zsh
# Edit the row in song-catalog.csv in Sheets, then:
./tidy-song-catalog
./update-song cho/ABC/B/BillyJoel/PianoMan.cho   # or use ./find-song PianoMan to get the path
./verify-catalog
```

### Planning a new gig

```zsh
./list-gigs                                                   # see existing gigs + song counts
./copy-gig 2026-05-10-rusty-nail 2026-06-14-rusty-nail        # clone a prior gig as a starting point
# open gigs.csv in Sheets
# reorder SET codes, swap songs as needed
./export-setlist --gig 2026-06-14-rusty-nail                  # preview the fan setlist (no Z-sets)
./export-setlist --gig 2026-06-14-rusty-nail --verbose        # preview with backup songs too
```

### Locking in a gig (finalising backing-track slots)

Run `assign-backing-track-slots` **after** the setlist order is finalised —
slot numbers are derived from SET code order, so changes to order after assignment
require a re-run.

```zsh
./assign-backing-track-slots --gig 2026-06-14-rusty-nail
# → Slots written to gigs.csv (this gig only)
# → {meta: rc-slot: N} patched into each affected .cho file
# → setlist.csv regenerated
```

Once slots are assigned, generate the RC-500 deploy script:

```zsh
# Generate for the latest gig (paths from application.properties):
./deploy-rc500

# Generate for a specific gig:
./deploy-rc500 --gig 2026-06-14-rusty-nail

# Override paths at the command line:
./deploy-rc500 --gig 2026-06-14-rusty-nail \
    --source /Volumes/G-DRIVE/BackingTracks \
    --target /Volumes/RC-500
```

This generates a `deploy-rc500-<timestamp>.sh` script you can review, trim
(e.g. just the songs for tonight’s practice), then run.

See [deploy-rc500](#deploy-rc500) for the full command reference.

### Adding songs to an existing gig

```zsh
./find-song-id "joel"              # find the SONG ID for the song you want
# paste the SONG ID + gig + SET code into gigs.csv in Sheets
./export-setlist --gig <gig-slug>  # verify the setlist looks right
```

### How commands run (build once, run fast)

The Java-backed command shims do **not** run `mvn spring-boot:run` on every
invocation (which adds ~5–10s of Maven overhead each time). Instead they
delegate to an internal launcher, **`cpt`**, which runs the packaged fat JAR
directly with `java -jar` — typically under **1 second**.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `./build` | Compile + package the fat JAR (`mvn package -DskipTests`). Run after code changes. |
| `./cpt <command> [args]` | Internal launcher. Runs the JAR directly; builds it automatically if missing; warns if Java sources are newer than the JAR. |

You rarely call these directly — every command shim (`./export-setlist`,
`./deploy-rc500`, …) delegates to `./cpt`. The flow:

```
./deploy-rc500 --gig …
   └─► ./cpt deploy-rc500 --gig …
          ├─ JAR missing?        → ./build, then run
          ├─ sources newer?      → warn "run ./build", run anyway
          └─ up to date          → java -jar … (fast path)
```

After editing any Java code, run `./build` once to refresh the JAR. If you
forget, the next command will warn you that sources are newer than the JAR.

> **Note:** `find-song-id` and `list-gigs` are inline Python scripts and
> `tidy-*`, `fix-*`, `copy*Setlist`, `lint-cho.zsh` are pure shell — none of
> these touch the JAR.

---

## 5. Commands

### `import-song`

**Script:** `./import-song <path-to-cho-file> [--dry-run]`

Registers a new `.cho` file in `song-catalog.csv`. The SONG ID is derived
automatically from the file path — you never construct it manually.

```zsh
# Preview what would be added, without modifying the catalog:
./import-song --dry-run cho/ABC/B/BillyJoel/MovingOut.cho

# Add the song to the catalog:
./import-song cho/ABC/B/BillyJoel/MovingOut.cho
```

#### What the `.cho` file needs at import time

Three directives are **required** before importing:

| Directive | Why |
|---|---|
| `{title: ...}` | Catalog display, setlist output, `find-song-id` search |
| `{artist: ...}` | Same — a row without an artist is a ghost in the catalog |
| `{key: ...}` | OnSong derives the key from the first chord if absent — always set it explicitly |

Everything else (tempo, duration, hardware presets, label) can be left blank
and filled in later via Google Sheets → `./tidy-song-catalog` → `./update-song`.

#### Path vs. metadata — simplified vs. full

The file **path** is a compact, filesystem-safe identifier. The **directives**
are the human-readable form and can carry more detail. The two don't need to
be identical — they just need to refer unambiguously to the same song.

**Artist:** use the primary/headline artist in the path. The `{artist:}`
directive can include the full credit.

```
cho/ABC/B/BrunoMars/UptownFunk.cho
  {artist: Bruno Mars ft. Mark Ronson}   ← full credit in metadata
  ↑ path uses primary artist only
```

**Title:** use the standard short name in the path. The `{title:}` directive
can include a parenthetical or subtitle that would make the filename unwieldy.

```
cho/STU/S/Supertramp/TheLogicalSong.cho
  {title: The Logical Song (What Are We)}   ← full title in metadata
  ↑ path uses the recognisable short form
```

#### Minimum viable `.cho` file

```
{title: Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)}
{artist: Billy Joel}
{key: A}
```

Guards:
- Throws if the `.cho` file does not exist
- Throws if the derived SONG ID already exists in the catalog

After importing, open `song-catalog.csv` in Google Sheets to fill in the
remaining metadata, then run `./tidy-song-catalog` and `./update-song` to
push it back into the `.cho` file.

---

### `verify-catalog`

**Script:** `./verify-catalog`

Reads every row in `song-catalog.csv`, opens the corresponding `.cho` file,
and compares their metadata field by field. Reports two classes of issues:

| Issue | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MISSING FILE` | The `.cho` file referenced by a catalog row does not exist on disk |
| `DRIFT` | One or more fields in the catalog row do not match the `.cho` header |

```zsh
./verify-catalog
# → verify-catalog: 487 clean, 0 issue(s) found
# → All catalog entries match their .cho files. ✓
```

Use `verify-catalog` as a sanity check after any bulk operation (e.g. after
running `update-songs` or after manually editing `.cho` files). Note that
`RC SLOT` is intentionally excluded from the comparison — it is a per-gig
assignment owned by `gigs.csv`, not a song property.

---

### `update-song` / `update-songs`

**Scripts:** `./update-song <path>`, `./update-songs`

Reads metadata from `song-catalog.csv` and writes it back into `.cho` file
headers. This is the primary way catalog edits flow back into the song files.

> `update-song` preserves any `{meta: rc-slot: N}` already in the file —
> a slot assigned by `assign-backing-track-slots` is never erased by a
> catalog update.

**Single song:**

```zsh
./update-song cho/ABC/B/BillyJoel/PianoMan.cho

# Find a song's path first if needed:
./find-song PianoMan
# → ./cho/ABC/B/BillyJoel/PianoMan.cho
```

**Batch:**

```zsh
# Edit updateSongsListing.txt — one .cho path per line
./update-songs
```

---

### `assign-backing-track-slots`

**Script:** `./assign-backing-track-slots [--gig <slug>] [--output <path>]`

The command to run when finalising a gig's setlist order. It assigns RC-500
backing-track slot numbers for every set-assigned RC song, then propagates
those numbers into `gigs.csv` and directly into the individual `.cho` files.

**What it does, in order:**

1. Loads `song-catalog.csv` + `gigs.csv` and resolves the target gig
2. Splits songs into **in-set** (SET prefix A–Y, sorted by SET code) and **backup** (SET prefix Z, sorted alphabetically by title)
3. Assigns RC-500 slot numbers — in-set from slot **5** upward, backup from slot **50** upward
4. Writes RC SLOT values for this gig into `gigs.csv` (**only this gig's rows are updated**)
5. Patches `{meta: rc-slot: N}` directly into each affected `.cho` file
6. Writes a fresh `setlist.csv`

```zsh
./assign-backing-track-slots                              # latest gig
./assign-backing-track-slots --gig 2026-06-14-rusty-nail  # specific gig
```

> **BeatBuddy songs** (`BACKING=BB`) are included in the setlist but skipped
> during slot assignment — BeatBuddy beat selection is done on the pedal itself.

> **Songs with no backing** (`BACKING` blank) are likewise skipped.

> Slots 1–4 are intentionally left free. Slots 50–99 are reserved for backup songs.

> Assignments for **other gigs are never touched**. Each gig maintains its own
> independent set of slot numbers.

---

### `copy-gig`

**Script:** `./copy-gig <source-gig> <target-gig> [--force]`

Clones all setlist assignments from an existing gig to a new gig slug. The
new rows are written with `TITLE` and `ARTIST` enriched from the catalog so
the CSV is immediately readable in Google Sheets.

```zsh
# Start next month's gig from last month's setlist
./copy-gig 2026-05-10-rusty-nail 2026-06-14-rusty-nail

# Re-clone over a target you have already started editing
./copy-gig 2026-05-10-rusty-nail 2026-06-14-rusty-nail --force
```

**RC SLOT is never copied.** The new gig's rows always start with a blank RC SLOT
column so slot numbers are assigned fresh when `assign-backing-track-slots` is run
for the new gig.

Guard-rails:
- Source gig must exist in `gigs.csv` — throws if not found
- Target gig must not already have assignments unless `--force` is passed

After cloning, open `gigs.csv` in Google Sheets, adjust SET codes to reorder
songs, and swap in different SONG IDs where the set list differs from the prior gig.

---

### `export-setlist`

**Script:** `./export-setlist [--gig <slug>] [--output <path>] [--verbose]`

Joins `song-catalog.csv` and `gigs.csv` for a specific gig, sorts by SET code,
and writes `setlist.csv`. Also prints a formatted summary table to the terminal.

**By default, only fan-facing songs (SET prefix A–Y) are included** — this is
the setlist to print on paper and send to fans. Use `--verbose` to include the
Z-set backup pool as well.

```zsh
# Fan setlist only (default) — most recent gig
./export-setlist

# Full list including backup songs
./export-setlist --verbose

# Specific gig, fan setlist
./export-setlist --gig 2026-06-14-rusty-nail

# Specific gig, full list, custom output path
./export-setlist --gig 2026-06-14-rusty-nail --verbose --output ./gig-2026-06-14.csv
```

**Terminal output example:**

```
Setlist export complete — 32 songs for gig '2026-06-05-FF' written to ./setlist.csv
  (backup / Z-set songs excluded — use --verbose to include them)

SET     TITLE                                     ARTIST                     KEY     BACKING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A01     Starting Over                             Chris Stapleton            E       5
A02     Against the Wind                          Bob Seger                  G       6
A03     Diamond Girl                              Seals & Crofts             D       7
...

  BACKUP / Z-SET                     ← only shown with --verbose
SET     TITLE                                     ARTIST                     KEY     BACKING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

The `BACKING` column shows:
- A slot number for RC-500 songs (from this gig's `gigs.csv` RC SLOT)
- `BB` for BeatBuddy songs
- blank for songs with no backing track

> `export-setlist` will throw if any assigned SONG ID is not found in
> `song-catalog.csv`. A missing base version is treated as a data integrity
> error, not a silent skip.

## 6. Utility Scripts

Most scripts are thin shell shims that invoke the Java CLI application.
`deploy-rc500` is a full Java-backed command that generates a throwaway script
rather than performing copies directly.

### `deploy-rc500`

**Script:** `./deploy-rc500 [OPTIONS]`
**Java command:** `deploy-rc500` → `GenerateRc500DeployScriptCommand` / `GenerateRc500DeployScriptService`

Generates a timestamped, human-editable shell script containing plain `cp`
commands to copy `backing.wav` and `click.wav` files from the local library
to the RC-500 looper pedal. Run this after `assign-backing-track-slots` has
locked in slot numbers for the gig.

The generated script is intentionally simple — just `cp` commands with
comments — so you can open it in any editor, remove songs you don’t need
(e.g. for a partial practice load), then run what’s left.

```zsh
# Generate for the latest gig (paths read from application.properties):
./deploy-rc500

# Specific gig:
./deploy-rc500 --gig 2026-06-14-rusty-nail

# Override source/target paths at the command line:
./deploy-rc500 --gig 2026-06-14-rusty-nail \
    --source /Volumes/G-DRIVE/BackingTracks \
    --target /Volumes/RC-500

# Write the generated script to a specific directory:
./deploy-rc500 --output-dir ~/Desktop
```

#### Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--gig` / `-g` | Gig slug. Defaults to the lexicographically latest gig in `gigs.csv`. |
| `--source` / `-s` | Root of the local backing-track library. Overrides `application.properties`. |
| `--target` / `-t` | RC-500 mount point / root directory. Overrides `application.properties`. |
| `--output-dir` / `-o` | Where to write the generated script (default: current directory). |

#### Source path layout

```
<source>/<CLUSTER>/<LETTER>/<Artist>/<SongTitle>/
  backing.wav    ← required
  click.wav      ← optional
```

Key-variant suffixes are stripped automatically — `SongId.getTitle()` already
holds the base title, so `BillyJoel:YouMayBeRight-g` → folder `YouMayBeRight/`
with no extra logic required.

#### Target path layout (standard RC-500 WAVE structure)

```
<target>/ROLAND/WAVE/
  <NNN>_1/backing.wav    ← NNN = RC slot zero-padded to 3 digits
  <NNN>_2/click.wav
```

Example: slot `7` → `007_1/backing.wav` and `007_2/click.wav`.

> **No `mkdir -p`.** The target directory structure is expected to already
> exist (either the live RC-500 or a pre-built local test mirror).
> The generated script contains only `cp` commands.

#### Generated script behaviour by case

| Situation at generation time | What appears in the script |
|---|---|
| `backing.wav` found | Live `cp` command |
| `backing.wav` missing | `⚠ WARNING` comment block; `cp` is commented out with the expect|
| `click.wav` found | Live `cp` command |
| `click.wav` missing | `# INFO` comment; line omitted (normal for some songs) |
| Song has no RC slot | Skipped entirely (not yet assigned — run `assign-backing-track-slots` first) |

#### Generated script format

```sh
#!/bin/zsh
# ===============================================================
# RC-500 Deploy Script
# Generated : 2026-06-14T09:15:03
# Gig       : 2026-06-14-rusty-nail

   "/Volumes/RC-500/ROLAND/WAVE/006_1/backing.wav"
# INFO: No click.wav found for BobSeger / AgainstTheWind — omitted

# ── SealsCrofts / DiamondGirl  [slot 007 / set A05] ─────────
# ⚠ WARNING: backing.wav NOT FOUND at generation time
# Expected : /Volumes/G-DRIVE/.../DiamondGirl/backing.wav
# Uncomment once the file is in place:
# cp ".../DiamondGirl/backing.wav" \
#    "/Volumes/RC-500/ROLAND/WAVE/007_1/backing.wav"
```

#### Configuration

Set the source and target paths in `application.properties` (committed,
but left blank by default since paths are machine-specific):

```properties
chordprotools.backing-source-root=/Volumes/G-DRIVE/BackingTracks
chordprotools.rc500-target-root=/Volumes/RC-500
```

Or pass them directly with `--source` / `--target` for one-off runs or
when testing against a local directory instead of the mounted pedal.

> Generated scripts are gitignored (`deploy-rc500-*.sh`) — they are
> throwaway artifacts, not source code.

### `find-song-id`

Search `song-catalog.csv` by title or artist fragment. Prints one row per song
(base version only), annotating how many key variants exist. The `SONG ID`
column is always a valid base ID safe to paste into `gigs.csv`.

```zsh
./find-song-id "piano"

TITLE         ARTIST       KEY   SONG ID                   VARIANTS
Piano Man     Billy Joel   C     ABC:B:BillyJoel:PianoMan  +1 key variant

./find-song-id "joel"
# → all Billy Joel songs
```

### `list-gigs`

List every gig slug in `gigs.csv` with a song count. Quick reference before
running `copy-gig` or `export-setlist`.

```zsh
./list-gigs

GIG                            SONGS
2026-05-10-rusty-nail          32
tbd                            2
```

### `find-song`

Search `.cho` files by filename fragment. Returns full paths suitable for
use in `update-song` or `updateSongsListing.txt`.

```zsh
./find-song PianoMan
# → ./cho/ABC/B/BillyJoel/PianoMan-a.cho
# → ./cho/ABC/B/BillyJoel/PianoMan.cho

./find-song HereComesMyGirl
# → ./cho/STU/T/TomPetty/HereComesMyGirl.cho
```

### `tidy-song-catalog` / `tidy-gigs`

Strips Windows-style carriage returns (`\r`) from `song-catalog.csv` and `gigs.csv`
respectively. Always run after saving either file from Google Sheets or Excel before
running any update command.

```zsh
./tidy-song-catalog   # cleans song-catalog.csv
./tidy-gigs           # cleans gigs.csv
```

### `fix-directive`

Bulk-updates all `.cho` files to replace legacy `{c:` comment directives
with the standards-compliant `{comment:` form.

```zsh
./fix-directive-dry-run   # preview
./fix-directive            # apply
```

### `lint-cho.zsh`

Lints `.cho` files for shorthand directives (e.g. `{soc}` → `{start_of_chorus}`).

```zsh
./lint-cho.zsh           # check mode — exits 1 if violations found
./lint-cho.zsh --fix     # fix mode — applies corrections in place
```

### `copyChoSetlist` / `copyAllSetlist` / `copyPdfSetlist` / `copySetlist`

Stage song files for import into OnSong or another reader app by copying
them into `~/tmp/setlist-ff/`.

| Script | What it copies |
|---|---|
| `./copyChoSetlist` | All `.cho` files (recreates the target directory) |
| `./copyAllSetlist` | All `.cho` + `.pdf` files |
| `./copyPdfSetlist` | PDF lead sheets only |
| `./copySetlist` | A hand-curated gig-specific list (edit the script to match the gig) |

## 8. Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | Java 21 |
| Framework | Spring Boot 3.5 |
| CLI | [picocli](https://picocli.info) via `picocli-spring-boot-starter` |
| CSV I/O | [OpenCSV](https://opencsv.sourceforge.net) |
| Build | Apache Maven |

The application follows a [Hexagonal Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software))
pattern — business logic in the domain layer has no dependency on how data
is stored or how commands are invoked.

## 9. How to Add a New Command

Adding a command requires touching files in a consistent, layered order.
`CopyGigService` and `ExportSetlistService` are good reference implementations.

### Step 1 — Domain model (if needed)

Create an immutable domain object in `application/domain/model/` using
Lombok `@Value` + `@Builder`, matching the pattern of `CatalogEntry` and
`SetlistAssignment`.

### Step 2 — Input port (use case interface)

Define what the command *does* as an interface in `application/port/in/`:

```java
public interface MyNewFeatureUseCase {
    int doTheThing(String input);
}
```

### Step 3 — Service implementation

Write business logic in `application/domain/service/`:

```java
@Service
@Slf4j
public class MyNewFeatureService implements MyNewFeatureUseCase {

    private final CatalogPort catalogPort;
    private final ChordproCatalogIndexPathConfig config;

    public MyNewFeatureService(CatalogPort catalogPort,
                               ChordproCatalogIndexPathConfig config) {
        this.catalogPort = catalogPort;
        this.config      = config;
    }

    @Override
    public int doTheThing(String input) {
        // business logic — depends only on ports and domain objects
    }
}
```

### Step 4 — picocli command

Add the CLI adapter in `adapter/in/file/`:

```java
@Component
@Command(name = "my-new-command", description = "Does the thing.")
@Slf4j
public class MyNewCommand implements Runnable {

    private final MyNewFeatureUseCase useCase;

    public MyNewCommand(MyNewFeatureUseCase useCase) {
        this.useCase = useCase;
    }

    @Parameters(index = "0", description = "The input value.")
    private String input;

    @Override
    public void run() {
        int result = useCase.doTheThing(input);
        System.out.printf("Done: %d item(s) processed.%n", result);
    }
}
```

Use `@Parameters` for positional arguments and `@Option` for named flags.

### Step 5 — Register the command

Add the new class to the `subcommands` list in `ChordproToolsMainCommand`:

```java
subcommands = {
    ImportNewSongCommand.class,
    VerifyCatalogCommand.class,
    UpdateSongCommand.class,
    UpdateSongsCommand.class,
    AssignBackingTrackSlotsCommand.class,
    CopyGigCommand.class,
    ExportSetlistCommand.class,
    MyNewCommand.class        // ← add here
}
```

### Step 6 — Shell script (optional but recommended)

```zsh
#!/bin/zsh
mvn -q spring-boot:run \
  -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="my-new-command $*"
```

```zsh
chmod +x my-new-command-script
```

### Step 7 — Test

Add a unit test under `src/test/`, mirroring the existing structure.
Mock collaborators with Mockito; test the service logic independently
of the Spring context. See `CopyGigServiceTest` for a complete example.

### Step 8 — Update this README

Add a row to the [Command Summary](#4-command-summary) table and a
section under [Commands](#5-commands).
