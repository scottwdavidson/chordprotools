[C#m]Last night I [B]dreamt of San [C#m]Pedro,
[A/C#]     Just   [C#m]like     I'd [E]never gone. I [B]knew the song,
A [C#m]young girl with [B]eyes like the [C#m]desert.
[A/C#]     It     [C#m]all     seems like [E]yesterday, not [B]far a[G#/C]way.

[C#m]Tropical the is[G#m]land [G#m7]breeze,
[F#m]All of nature, wi[E]ld and free.
[B]This is where I long [B/F#]to [F#m]be,
[F#m]La  isla  [B]bo - [C#m]ni - ta.
[C#m] And when the [G#m]samba [G#m7]played,
[F#m] The sun would set[E] so high, and ring
[B]through my ears and [B/F#]sting my [F#m]eyes
Your [F#m]Spanish lul - [B]lab - [C#m]y.

[C#m]I fell in [B]love with San [C#m]Pedro,
[A/C#] Warm [C#m]wind carried [E]on the sea. He [B]called to me,
[C#m]  Te [B]dijo: "te [C#m]amo." 
[A/C#] I   [C#m]prayed that the [E]days would last, they [B]went so [G#/C]fast.

[F#m]I want to [D]be where the [E]sun warms the [Bsus2]sky.
When it's [F#m]time for si[D]esta you can [E]watch them go by.
[F#m]Beautiful [D]faces, no [E]cares in this [Bsus2]world.
Where a [F#m]girl loves a [D]boy, and a [E]boy___ [G#/C#]loves a [C#m]girl.
