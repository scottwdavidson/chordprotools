T[Am]oo many long conve[Em]rsations
And [Dm]no one is hearin' a w[G]ord
Just t[Am]ryin' to escape the fr[Em]ustrations
Till a s[F]ong in the ni[G]ght can be h[C]eard

P[C]ut on your d[Em]ancin' [F]shoes[G]
Th[C]row out those [Em]one night [F]blues[G]
He[C]re's one to [Em]love and to c[F]hance[C/E]
For a s[Dm]pin on that wh[G]eel of ro[C]mance
{eoc}

{sov}
Too s[Am]low to unriddle your pr[Em]oblems
Too lo[Dm]nely for someone to c[G]are
L[Am]ong lonely silence keeps ha[Em]unting
Till the s[F]ong in the n[G]ight finds you th[C]ere

P[C]ut on your d[Em]ancin' [F]shoes[G]
T[C]hrow out those [Em]one night b[F]lues[G]
[C]Here's one to [Em]love and to c[F]hance[C/E]
For a s[Dm]pin on that w[G]heel
S[Dm]pin on that wh[G]eel
S[Dm]pin on that wh[G]eel of ro[C]mance

The f[Am]ace like an angel, she's w[Em]aiting
She sm[Dm]iles and looks o[G]ver at y[C]ou
You y[Am]earn for this si[Em]tuation
Now fi[F]nally, your dr[G]eams have come t[C]rue
O[G]oh ooh ooh

C[Dm]aught on that w[G]heel
C[Dm]aught on that w[G]heel
Ca[Dm]ught on that wh[G]eel of rom[C]ance
