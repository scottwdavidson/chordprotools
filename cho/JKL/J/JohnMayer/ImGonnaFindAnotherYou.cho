[Bm]  I'm gonna find[E7]  another you[A][D/F#][D/F]
[A]  [E7]  You take your swea[A]ters

{start_of_verse}
You take[A7]your time
You might have your rea[D/F#]sons

[Bm7]When I was your lover[F#m]
[Bm7]No one else would do[F#m]
If I'm [Bm7]forced to find another[F#m]
I hope she [B7]looks like you
Yeah and she's[E]nicer too yeah
So go on [A]baby


{start_of_verse}
Make your little [A7]get away
My pride will keep me [D/F#]company
And you just gave [Ebdim7]yours all away[Cdim7][Ebdim7]
Oh[A] Now I'm gon[G#]na [F#]dress myself for two
[Bm]  Once for me and once for [E7]someone new
I'm gonna [C#m7]do  somethings you wouldn't [F#7]let me do
Oh[Bm7]   I'm gonna [E7]find another you
