{start_of_verse}
I took my love and I took it down. 
I climbed a mountain and I turned it around.  And I
saw my reflection in the  snow covered hills till the
landslide brought me down.  Oh,
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Mirror in the sky,  what is love?  Can the child
within my heart rise above?  Can I
sail through the changing ocean tides?  Can I
handle the seasons of my l__i__f__e? 
Mmmm,  
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Well, I’ve been afraid of changing ’cause I
built my life  around you.   But
time makes you bolder. Children get older and
I’m getting older, too.  So...
{end_of_chorus}

take this love, take it down.  Oh,
if you climb a mountain and you turn around,  if you
see my reflection in the snow covered hills well, the
landslide will bring it down,  down.

{comment: Outro}
And if you see my reflection in the  snow covered hills (hold) well, maybe the
landslide’ll bring it down. Well,  well, the
landslide’ll bring it down.
