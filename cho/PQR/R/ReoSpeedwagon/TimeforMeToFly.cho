[D]I've been around for you,
[Aadd4]Been up and down for you,
But [Gadd9]I just can't get any relief. |  D  Gadd9/D  D  Gadd9/D  D |
I've [D]swallowed my pride for you,
[Aadd4]Lived and lied for you,
But [Gadd9]you still make me feel like a thief. |  D  Gadd9/D  D  Gadd9/D  D |

You got me [Aadd4]stealing your love away
Cause [Gadd9]you never [D]give it.
[Aadd4]Peeling the years away
And [Gadd9]we can't re[D]live it.
[Gadd9]I make you [D]laugh
And [Gadd9]you make me [D]cry.
[Aadd4] I believe it's time for me to fly.

{sov}
[D]You said we'd work it out.
You [Aadd4]said that you had no doubt,
That [Gadd9]deep down we were really in love. |  D  Gadd9/D  D  Gadd9/D  D |
Oh, but I'm [D]tired of holding on
To a [Aadd4]feeling I know is gone.
I [Gadd9]do believe that I've had enough. |  D  Gadd9/D  D  Gadd9/D  D |

I've had e[Aadd4]nough of the falseness
Of a [Gadd9]worn out re[D]lation.
E[Aadd4]nough of the jealousy
And the [Gadd9]intole[D]ration.
[Gadd9]I make you [D]laugh
And [Gadd9]you make me [D]cry.
[Aadd4] I believe it's time for me to fly. |  D  Gadd9  |  D  |

[Tacet] (Time for me to fly.} [Aadd4]
Oh, I've got to [Gadd9]set myself [D]free.
[D] (Time for me to fly.) [Aadd4]
And that's just how [Gadd9]it's got to [D]be.
[Gadd9]I know it hurts to say good[Aadd4]bye
But it's time for me to [Gadd9]fly - [Aadd4]yy
