{start_of_verse}
We had [Am]broken up for good just an [F]hour before
Uh uh [G]uh uh uh uh uh [Am]uh

Now I'm [Am]staring at the bodies as they're d[F]ancing 'cross the floor
Uh uh [G]uh uh uh uh uh [Am]uh

And then the [Am]band slowed the tempo when the [F]music took you down
Uh uh [G]uh uh uh uh uh [Am]uh

{c: BB-PART-02}
It was the [Am]same old song with the [F]melancholy sound
Uh uh [G]uh uh uh uh uh [Am]uh[G]

Uh uh [G]uh uh uh uh uh [Am]uh

[Am]But now it feels so strange out in the [F]atmospheres
Uh uh [G]uh uh uh uh uh [Am]uh

[Am]And then the jukebox plays a song I [F]used to know
Uh uh [G]uh uh uh uh uh [Am]uh
