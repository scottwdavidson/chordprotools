[G]Friday night I crashed your party,
Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out ag[D]ain.
I was o[Am]nly having fun,
wasn't hu[F]rting anyone
and we a[D]ll enjoyed the weekend for a ch[G]ange.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I've been s[G]tranded in the combat zone,
I walked through Bedford-Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the r[D]ain.
And you t[Am]old me not to drive,
but I mad[F]e it home alive
So you sa[D]id that only proves that I'm in[G]sane.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
You may be r[D]ight,
I may be cr[G]azy
But it j[D]ust may be a l[C]unatic
you're l[Em]ooking for[G]
Turn out the li[D]ghts,
don't try to sa[G]ve me
You may be wr[C]ong for all I kn[D]ow,
you may be r[G]ight.

Rem[G]ember how I found you there,
alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you sm[D]iled.
You were l[Am]onely for a man,
I said t[F]ake me as I am
'Cause you m[D]ight enjoy some madness for a w[G]hile.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now th[G]ink of all the years you tried to
find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you s[D]ay.
If I'm cr[Am]azy then it's true,
that it's a[F]ll because of you
and you w[D]ouldn't want me any other [G]way.

{start_of_chorus}
You may be r[D]ight,
I may be cr[G]azy
But it j[D]ust may be a l[C]unatic
you're l[Em]ooking for[G]
Turn out the li[D]ghts,
don't try to sa[G]ve me
You may be wr[C]ong for all I kn[D]ow,
you may be r[G]ight.
