It's [C]nine o'[G/B]clock on a [F/A]Saturday,[C/G]     
[F]the regular [C/E]crowd shuffles [D7]in[G]

making [F]love to his [G7sus]tonic and [C]gin

{sov}
He says [C]son, can you [G/B]play me a [F/A]memory[C/G]   
I'm [F]not really s[C/E]ure how it [D7]goes[G]
But it's [C]sad and it's [G/B]sweet and 
I [F/A]knew it [C/G]complete when 
[F]I wore a [G11]younger man's [C]clothes

{sov}
Now [C]John at the b[Em/B]ar is a [F/A]friend of mine[C/G],
He [F]gets me my [C/E]drinks for f[D7]ree[G].
And he's [C]quick with a jo[Em/B]ke or to li[F/A]ght up your smo[C/G]ke
But there's [F]some place that h[G11]e'd rather b[C]e.
{eov}


{sov}
[F/C]    He says [C]Bill I bel[Em/B]ieve this is [F/A]killing me[C/G]
As the [F]smile ran a[C/E]way from his [D7]face[G].
Well, I'm [C]sure that I [Em/B]could be a m[F/A]ovie sta[C/G]r
If [F]I could get o[G11]ut of this p[C]lace.

Now [C]Paul is a [Em/B]real estate [F/A]novelis[C/G]t
Who [F]never had t[C/E]ime for a w[D7]ife[G]
And he's t[C]alking with [Em/B]Davy who's s[F/A]till in the [C/G]navy
And [F]probably [G11]will be for [C]life.

And the w[C]aitress is [Em/B]practising [F/A]politics[C/G]
As the [F]businessmen [C/E]slowly get s[D7]toned[G]
Yes, they're [C]sharing a d[Em/B]rink they call [F/A]loneliness[C/G]
But it's [F]better than [G11]drinking a[C]lone.

It's a [C]pretty[G/B] good crow[F/A]d for a S[C/G]aturday
[F]and the [C/E]manager gives m[D7]e a smile.
[G]Cause he know[C]s that i[G/B]t's me they[F/A]'ve been co[C/G]ming to s[F]ee,
To forget[G11] about lif[C]e for a while
