[A]Ain't but one way out baby, Lord, I just can't go out the door.
[D]Ain't but one way out baby, Lord, I just can't go out the [A]door.
'Cause there's a [E]man down there, m[D]ight be your man, I don't [A]know.


[A]Lord, you got me trapped woman, up on the second floor;

If I get by this time I won't be trapped no more.
[D]So raise our window baby, I can ease out soft and [A]slow.
And Lord, your [E]neighbors, no, they won't be
[D]Talking that stuff that they don't [A]know.


[A]Lord, I'm foolish to be here in the first place,

I know some man gonna walk in and take my place.
[D]Ain't no way in the world, I'm going out that front do[A]or
'Cause there's a m[E]an down there, [D]might be your man, I don't kn[A]ow.
'Cause there's a m[E]an down there, [D]might be your man, I don't kn[A]ow.
'Cause there's a m[E]an down there, [D]might be your man, I don't kn[A]ow.
