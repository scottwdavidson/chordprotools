[G] So she said, "What's the [C]problem baby?"
[G] What's the problem? I don't [C]know. Well, maybe I'm in [Em]love (love).
Think about it, [A]every time I think about it, [C]can't stop thinking 'bout it.
[G] How much longer will it [C]take to cure this?
[G] Just to cure it 'cause I [C]can't ignore it if it's [Em]love (love).
Makes me wanna [A]turn around and face me
But I [D]don't know nothing 'bout [C]love. Ahhhh.

[G] So I said I'm a [C]snowball running.
[G] Running down into the [C]spring that's coming. All this [Em]love
Melting under [A]blue skies belting out [C]sunlight shimmering [G]love.
Well baby [C]I surrender to the [G]strawberry ice cream.
[C]Never ever end of all this [Em]love.
Well, I [A]didn't mean to do it, but there's[D] no escaping your [C]love.   Ahhhhh.

[Em] These lines of [C]lightning mean we're [G]never alone,
[Am]never alone, [N.C.] no no.

[G]Come on, [Am]come on, [C]move a little [D]closer.
[G]Come on, [Am]come on, I [C]want to hear you [D]whisper.
[G]Come on, [Am]come on,
[C]Settle down ins[D]ide my [Em]love. [D] Ahhhh.

[G]Come on, [Am]come on, [C]jump a little [D]higher.
[G]Come on, [Am]come on, if you [C]feel a little [D]lighter.
