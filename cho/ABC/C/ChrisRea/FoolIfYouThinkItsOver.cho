[Am7]A dying      [D]flame, [Bm7]    you're free   [Em7]again
[Am7]Who could       [D]love  [Gmaj7]      and do that to [G7]you
[Am7]All dressed in [Dsus4]black,[D]  [Bm7]    he won't be [Em7]coming back
[Am7]Save your     [D]tears,    [Esus4]you've got years and years[E7]
[Am7]The pains of  [Dsus4]seven      [D]teen's
[Gmaj7]Unreal they're [Em7]only dreams
[Am7]Save your [Dsus4]crying[D] for the [Esus4]day[E7]

'Co[Gmaj7]s you said good       bye[Em7]
Foo[Am7]l if you think it's ove[Dsus4]r[D]
I'll tell you why[Esus4][E7]
New[Am7] born eyes always   cry[Dsus4] with pai[D]n
At [Gmaj7]the first look at the mor[Em7]ning sun
Fool if you [Am7]think it's over[Dsus4][D]
It's just   begun[Esus4][E7]

Mis[Am7]s teenage dre[D]am,    [Bm7] such a tragic sce[Em7]ne
He [Am7]knocked your cr[Dsus4]own   [D]  [Bm7]  and ran       [Em7]away
Fir[Am7]st wound of pri[Dsus4]de    [D]  [Bm7] but how you cri[Em7]ed and cried
But[Am7] save your tea[D]rs        [Esus4]   you've got years and yea[E7]rs
